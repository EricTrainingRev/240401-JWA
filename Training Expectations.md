# Teams Etiquette
- Turn your camera on before you start talking
    - if your camera is off when you talk you will be asked to turn it on before receiving an answer
- Communicate any technical issues with your mic or camera before training starts if possible
- Be conscious of your environment:
    - make sure you are muted if you are not talking
    - make sure you are in an environment suitable for training
        - quiet
        - few distractions
        - good lighting

- Practice Examples

# Required Software/Tools
- IDE (pick one, or download both)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
        - I highly recommend you check the "Open with Visual Studio Code" options when you download VSC: while not necessary, it will provide a very nice quality-of-life feature for right clicking on a directory or file and opening it in VSC directly
    - [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=&section=windows)
        - similar to VSC, I recommend enabling the option to "open with Intellij" to open directories directly with the application 
- [Github Account](https://github.com/)
    - after you create a Github account you will need to install a local version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        - we will be using GitBash, so much sure the "Git Bash here" box is checked under Windows Explorer Integration on the Select Components page
        - on the "Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories" page I recommend you choose the lower option to override the default naming convention and choose the default name of "main". Again, this is not necessary, but it will make things more consistent between your local Git software and your Github default settings
        - if you have experience with Node, Python, or other programming languages that make constant use of the terminal, I recommend checking the "Enable Experimental Support for psuedo consoles" option on the experimental options page
