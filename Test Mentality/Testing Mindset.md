# Tester MindSet
Tester MindSet encompasses several key aspects. First, there’s **Professional Pessimism**, where testers anticipate that what is built will likely fail. Another beneficial mindset is **Curiosity and Experimentation**: these drive testers to explore and try new approaches. Finally, **Collaborative Thinking** is a critical mindset for testers: they act as intermediaries between developers and clients, and the more successful testers are at finding defects the more robust and reliable the developers can make the application

# Developer Mindset
Likewise, a Developer Mindset encompasses multiple avenues of thinking. First, there’s the belief that what is built will work: this **Optimistic Assumption** drives development efforts. However, it’s essential to be aware of **Confirmation Bias**, a cognitive tendency that can impact testing. When developers are directly involved in testing their own code, they may unintentionally overlook issues because they are biased towards confirming that their solution works. This bias makes it difficult to find problems objectively. For critical features, **Independent Testers Are Preferred**. Their impartial perspective helps mitigate confirmation bias and ensures thorough testing, ultimately enhancing the software the developers create
