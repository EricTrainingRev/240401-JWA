# Objectives of Testing
The **Objectives of Testing** are varied, but there are several key goals. First, we test to **Minimize The Risk Of Defects** reaching the final application. By identifying and addressing issues early, testing helps to create a more reliable product users can be confident using. Testing is also essential to **Verify That All Requirements Are Met**, whether functional, performance, or security related. Successful testing instills confidence that an application **Works as Intended**, assuring stakeholders that it will perform reliably in real-world scenarios. Finally, testing helps organizations **Comply With Legal or Compliance Regulations**, ensuring that the software adheres to relevant standards and guidelines. This one is particularly important, as regulatory bodies across the world will have different standards software must meet in order for companies to offer their services without penalty

# Quality Management
**Quality Management** covers various aspects related to maintaining "quality" within a company. It involves two critical components:

- **Quality Assurance**
    - Quality Assurance entails following standard procedures and processes to ensure that the product or service provided meets the required "quality" standards of the company
- **Quality Control**: 
    - Quality control encompasses various activities and testing procedures aimed at identifying and addressing any issues that might impact the quality of the final service output

# Requirements
Considering **Requirements** is important for software testers:
- Understanding **Business Requirements** helps testers align their efforts with the overall vision and objectives, ensuring that the software meets the needs of stakeholders and contributes to business success
- **Software Requirements** specify what the software should do in terms of features, functionality, and behavior, guiding testers in creating test scenarios and validating that the software meets user expectations
- **Functional Requirements** describe specific functionalities the software must provide, serving as a basis for creating test cases and ensuring comprehensive coverage
- **Non-Functional Requirements** address quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability, enhancing user satisfaction, and overall system stability

Considering these requirements helps ensure the software aligns with business goals, functions correctly, and meets quality standards. Itâ€™s like building a sturdy bridge: one needs a solid foundation (requirements) to support the entire structure (application)

# Verification vs Validation
- **Verification**: Does the software meet requirements
- **Validation**: Does the software actually fulfill the client's expectations
